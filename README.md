The DCSA Information Model
==========================
The DCSA Information Model has been created to organise and catalogue the information being generated or consumed in connection with the processes described in the DCSA Industry Blueprint. The information model is also used as a collective term to describe all products that model data needed to meet the interface requirements. The information model includes a diagrammatic representation of selected data entities and their relationships with one another.

By standardising the terms used and documenting the related data, the DCSA Information Model is designed to provide a foundation that can be used in the current interface standardisation work and for future initiatives. DCSA recognises that there is a variety of standards that exist today and endeavours to reuse these resources where appropriate within the context of the container shipping industry. Some of these existing standards are more widely adopted than others, such as the UN/CEFACT Multimodal Transport Reference Data Model (MMT RDM). It is the intention of DCSA to constantly evaluate the DCSA Information Model against this and other standards.

This repository contains a Postgresql based implementation of the model.
