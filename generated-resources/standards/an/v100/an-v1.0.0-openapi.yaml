    # DCSA Arrival Notice API

    This is the OpenAPI specification of the **DCSA Arrival Notice** standard.

    This API allows the transfer of structured arrival notice documents, including optional embedded PDF visualizations, from a publisher to a subscriber.

    The arrival notice publisher implements the `GET` endpoint, which authorized API consumers can call to retrieve available arrival notices.

    The arrival notice subscribers implement the `POST /arrival-notices` endpoint, which arrival notice publishers call to send relevant arrival notices as they become available.

    The arrival notice subscribers implement the `POST /arrival-notice-notifications` endpoint, which arrival notice publishers call to send lightweight notifications about relevant arrival notices as they become available. When subscribers receive such notifications, they can choose to call the `GET` endpoint to retrieve the arrival notices that are relevant to them at the time.

    The registration of subscribers with arrival notice publishers is out of scope.

    The authentication and authorization in both directions between arrival notice publishers and subscribers is out of scope.

      summary: "Retrieves a list of arrival notices"
      description: |
        Retrieves the list of arrival notices matching the criteria provided as query parameters.

        If no arrival notices match the criteria provided as query parameters, the response should not be an HTTP 404 error message, but a regular HTTP 200 response with an empty array in the message body.

        The ordering of arrival notices in the response message is unspecified.

        The arrival notice publisher is expected to additionally filter the arrival notices based on the authorization and registration profile of the authenticated party calling this endpoint, for example by returning only arrival notices with or without charges, or localized for a certain region or in a certain language. Authorization, registration and any such additional filtering are out of scope in this standard.

        ## Filtering

        Every arrival notice publisher **must** support the retrieval of arrival notices based on the transport document references of one or more bills of lading, specified as the value(s) of the `transportDocumentReferences` query parameter.

        Each arrival notice publisher can decide whether to support any of the additional filtering query parameters defined in the standard for this endpoint, and should document the decision in their published copy of the API specification.

        When receiving requests containing an unsupported query parameter, an arrival notice publisher can choose to either ignore the query parameter (if possible) or to reject the request with an HTTP 400. In particular, the publisher can reject with HTTP 400 a GET request with a number of `transportDocumentReferences` or `equipmentReferences` larger than the maximum supported (which in the case of some publishers is likely to be `1`). Publishers should document these limits in their copy of the API specification.

        If multiple versions of an arrival notice exists, only the latest version will be returned in the result. The standard does not provide a way to retrieve older versions of an arrival notice.

        ### Filtering by transport document reference

        When filtering using the `transportDocumentReferences` query parameter, the response contains arrival notices for all the bills of lading with the specified transport document reference for which an arrival notice is available (and accessible by the party making the API request).

        Even when requesting arrival notices for a single transport document reference, in the absence of further explicit filtering in the request or implicit filtering by the arrival notice publisher, the response is expected to contain all the arrival notices corresponding to that bill of lading: with or without charges, and in every language in which it is available.

        ### Filtering alternatives to the transport document reference

        As an alternative to retrieving arrival notices by the bill of lading using the `transportDocumentReferences` query parameter, if support is implemented by the arrival notice publisher, it is also possible to filter arrival notices using these query parameters:
        * `equipmentReferences`
        * `portOfDischarge`
        * `vesselIMONumber` or `vesselName`
        * `carrierImportVoyageNumber` or `universalImportVoyageReference`
        * `carrierServiceCode` or `universalServiceReference`

        The arrival notice publisher can decide to also allow retrieving arrival notices without specifying any of these filtering query parameters, instead filtering the results only based on the authorization and registration profile of the authenticated party calling this endpoint.

        ### Filtering by POD arrival date

        Whenever the query parameters filter could retrieve large number of historical arrival notices (for example when filtering only by vessel name or IMO number), the request should also include at least the `portOfDischargeArrivalDateMin` query parameter and could also include the `portOfDischargeArrivalDateMax` query parameter.

        The arrival notice publisher can separately also decide to have default relative date ranges and only return arrival notices having a `portOfDischargeArrivalDate` within those ranges.

        ### Filtering by region or language

        There are no query parameters with which to request the filtering of arrival notices based on language or any other content or format localization for a specific region.

        ## Pagination

        Response pagination uses a mechanism based on the `limit` and `cursor` query parameters and on the `Next-Page-Cursor` response header.

        ### Optional support

        Each arrival notice publisher can decide whether to support the pagination of results, or to only allow limiting the response size using filtering query parameters.

        If the arrival notice publisher does not provide pagination support, it can choose to either reject with an HTTP 400 any request containing the `limit` or `cursor` query parameters, or to handle the request normally while silently ignoring the pagination query parameters.

        ### Enabling pagination

        The arrival notice retriever can use the `limit` query parameter to specify a maximum number of arrival notice objects that should be included in the response.

        The arrival notice publisher can separately choose (and document on their copy of the published API specification) its own limit to the number of arrival notice objects that it would include in responses.

        The effective page size limit is the minimum between the `limit` query parameter (if specified) and the publisher's own maximum page size configuration setting.

        ### Retrieving results pages

        If based on filtering the response would include more arrival notices than this effective page size limit, the arrival notice publisher only adds arrival notices to the response up to this effective page size limit, setting in the response the `Next-Page-Cursor` to a value that it can accept as the value of the `cursor` query parameter in a subsequent request and use it to return the next page of results.

        The API client reads the value of the `Next-Page-Cursor` response header and sets it as the value of the `cursor` query parameter in its next request.

        The API client **must** keep alongside the `cursor` all the original query parameters from the request that retrieved the first page, in order to allow either a stateful or a stateless implementation of the pagination mechanism by the arrival notice publisher.

        The effect of changing any of the original query parameters in subsequent pagination requests is unspecified and may result in the rejection of the request by the arrival notice publisher with an HTTP 4xx response.

        The effect of attempting to use a cursor more than once (for example to "go back" to previous pages) is unspecified and may result in the rejection of the request by the arrival notice publisher with an HTTP 4xx response. (This is by design a backend-to-backend API, not intended for use directly from frontend applications and therefore not directly supporting a typical full set of web frontend pagination actions.)

        When responding with the last page of results, the arrival notice publisher no longer includes a `Next-Page-Cursor` response header. The last page of results may be empty, for example in the case of a stateless pagination implementation by the arrival notice publisher.

          Optional flag indicating whether the PDF `arrivalNoticeVisualization` should be included in each returned arrival notice.

          The publisher makes the final decision on whether to include PDF visualizations in the response (for some or for all
          the arrival notices), based on a variety of factors including:
          - whether it has implemented support for including PDF visualizations
          - the API consumer (role, registration profile, business relationship)
          - the type and availability status of the returned arrival notices.

          However, to support a future transition to fully automated processing of arrival notices by receivers,
          the publisher should **not** include the PDF visualization if this parameter is set to `false`.
        schema:
          type: "boolean"
        example: true
      - name: "removeCharges"

        description: |
          Optional flag indicating whether the publisher should remove the charges from the PDF visualization
          of every returned arrival notice, and for consistency, also from the structured response data.

          This flag allows arrival notice receivers to retrieve, for the purpose of forwarding to third parties,
          versions of the arrival notice PDF visualizations in which the charges are removed,
          if they would be normally received with charges included based on the role of the arrival notice recipient.

          This flag is **not** expected to perform any filtering on the list of arrival notices included in the response.
          However, if the removal of charges (from the arrival notices that have them) results in a list of arrival notices
          in which some become exact duplicates, publishers may choose to remove duplicates from the response.

          The default value is `false`, which leaves unchanged the presence or absence of charges in each returned arrival notice.

            Each publisher can choose their own criteria by which they categorize arrival notices,
            as well as the format of this property. However, for each arrival notice publisher
            the format must be consistent and predictable, in order to allow receivers
            to programmatically determine whether each received arrival notice overrides
            an earlier version of the arrival notice "of the same type" for the same transport document.

            An arrival notice (including all its versions) is uniquely identified by the combination
            of the `transportDocumentReference` and this `typeLabel`. Each version of an arrival notice
            is uniquely identified by the combination of the `transportDocumentReference`, this `typeLabel`
            and the `issueDateTime`.

            Among the versions of arrival notices of the same type issued for the same transport document,
            a version with a newer `issueDateTime` overrides a version with an older `issueDateTime`,
            regardless of the `versionLabel` (which is a high-level label with business semantics
            and may or may not change between timestamped versions).
          example: "English, consignee, USD"
        versionLabel:
          maxLength: 1000
          type: "string"

            for example "Warning", "Updated", "Second", "Third" etc.

            This is a high-level label with business semantics that does not influence the technical versioning
            of arrival notices of the same `typeLabel` issued for the same `transportDocumentReference`,
            which relies on the `issueDateTime` instead.

            Globally unique identifier of a liner service, assigned by carriers as specified by DCSA.

            DCSA generates and distributes batches of Universal Service References (USRs)
            to member and non-member carriers upon request, for their own use or for their alliances and VSAs.

            A carrier can use each of its assigned USRs either in agreement with its partners for a service under a VSA or Alliance,
            or independently for one of its own non-VSA, non-Alliance services.

            Every Universal Service Reference is an 8-character string with the following format:
             * the prefix "SR"
             * 5 digits
