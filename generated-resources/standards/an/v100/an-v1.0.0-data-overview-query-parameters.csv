includeVisualization,boolean,"Optional flag indicating whether the PDF `arrivalNoticeVisualization` should be included in each returned arrival notice.

The publisher makes the final decision on whether to include PDF visualizations in the response (for some or for all
the arrival notices), based on a variety of factors including:
- whether it has implemented support for including PDF visualizations
- the API consumer (role, registration profile, business relationship)
- the type and availability status of the returned arrival notices.

However, to support a future transition to fully automated processing of arrival notices by receivers,
the publisher should **not** include the PDF visualization if this parameter is set to `false`.",true
removeCharges,boolean,"Optional flag indicating whether the publisher should remove the charges from the PDF visualization
of every returned arrival notice, and for consistency, also from the structured response data.

This flag allows arrival notice receivers to retrieve, for the purpose of forwarding to third parties,
versions of the arrival notice PDF visualizations in which the charges are removed,
if they would be normally received with charges included based on the role of the arrival notice recipient.

This flag is **not** expected to perform any filtering on the list of arrival notices included in the response.
However, if the removal of charges (from the arrival notices that have them) results in a list of arrival notices
in which some become exact duplicates, publishers may choose to remove duplicates from the response.

The default value is `false`, which leaves unchanged the presence or absence of charges in each returned arrival notice.",true
