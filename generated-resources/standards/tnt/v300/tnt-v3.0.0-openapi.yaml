    # DCSA Track and Trace API

    This is the OpenAPI specification of the **DCSA Track and Trace** standard.

    This API allows the transfer of structured track and trace Events from an  Event Producer to an Event Consumer.

    Each Event Producer implements the `GET /events` endpoint, which can be called by the authorized Event Consumers to retrieve relevant available Events.

    Each Event Consumer implements the `POST /events` endpoint, which can be called by Event Producers call to send relevant Events as they become available.

    The registration of Event Consumers with Event Producers is out of scope.

    The authentication and authorization in both directions between Event Producers and Event Consumers is out of scope.

    ### Work in progress ⚠️

    The DCSA Track and Trace standard, including this API, is currently being designed and is **not** ready for general adoption yet.

      summary: "Retrieves a list of events"
      description: |
        Retrieves the list of Events matching the criteria provided as query parameters.

        If no Events match the criteria provided as query parameters, the response should not be an HTTP 404 error message, but a regular HTTP 200 response with an empty array in the message body.

        The ordering of Events in the response message is unspecified.

        The Event Producer is expected to additionally filter the Events based on the authorization and registration profile of the authenticated Event Consumer calling this endpoint. Authorization, registration and any such additional filtering are out of scope in this standard.

        ## Event filtering

        Every Event Producer must support the following combinations of query parameter filters:
        * `carrierBookingReference`
        * `carrierBookingReference`, `equipmentReference`
        * `transportDocumentReference`
        * `transportDocumentReference`, `equipmentReference`
        * `equipmentReference`

        Every Event Producer must support combining any of the query parameter filters above with a list of `eventTypes`. By default, events of all `eventTypes` are expected to be returned if available and supported.

        Every Event Producer must support combining any of the query parameter filters above with all of these additional filters:
        * `eventUpdatedDateTimeMin`
        * `eventUpdatedDateTimeMax`
        * `eventUpdatedDateTimeMin`, `eventUpdatedDateTimeMax`

        Each Event Producer can separately also decide to have default relative date ranges and only return Events having an `eventUpdatedDateTime` within those ranges.

        When receiving requests containing an unsupported query parameter, an Event Producer can choose to either ignore the query parameter (if possible) or to reject the request with an HTTP 400.

        ## Pagination

        Response pagination uses a mechanism based on the `limit` and `cursor` query parameters and on the `Next-Page-Cursor` response header.

        ### Optional support

        Each Event Producer can decide whether to support the pagination of results, or to only allow limiting the response size using filtering query parameters.

        If the Event Producer does not provide pagination support, it can choose to either reject with an HTTP 400 any request containing the `limit` or `cursor` query parameters, or to handle the request normally while silently ignoring the pagination query parameters.

        ### Enabling pagination

        The Event Consumer can use the `limit` query parameter to specify a maximum number of Events that should be included in the response.

        The Event Producer can separately choose (and document on their copy of the published API specification) its own limit to the number of Events that it would include in responses.

        The effective page size limit is the minimum between the `limit` query parameter (if specified) and the Event Producer's own maximum page size configuration setting.

        ### Retrieving results pages

        If based on filtering the response would include more Events than this effective page size limit, the Event Producer only adds Events to the response up to this effective page size limit, setting in the response the `Next-Page-Cursor` to a value that it can accept as the value of the `cursor` query parameter in a subsequent request and use it to return the next page of results.

        The Event Consumer reads the value of the `Next-Page-Cursor` response header and sets it as the value of the `cursor` query parameter in its next request.

        The Event Consumer **must** keep alongside the `cursor` all the original query parameters from the request that retrieved the first page, in order to allow either a stateful or a stateless implementation of the pagination mechanism by the Event Producer.

        The effect of changing any of the original query parameters in subsequent pagination requests is unspecified and may result in the rejection of the request by the Event Producer with an HTTP 4xx response.

        The effect of attempting to use a cursor more than once (for example to "go back" to previous pages) is unspecified and may result in the rejection of the request by the Event Producer with an HTTP 4xx response. (This is by design a backend-to-backend API, not intended for use directly from frontend applications and therefore not directly supporting a typical full set of web frontend pagination actions.)

        When responding with the last page of results, the Event Producer no longer includes a `Next-Page-Cursor` response header. The last page of results may be empty, for example in the case of a stateless pagination implementation by the Event Producer.

            ID of the event, unique among all the events published by a T&T Event Producer.

            An event overrides any other event that has the same `eventID` and an earlier `eventUpdatedDateTime`.

            Each event is uniquely identified within each T&T 3.x standard ecosystem of connected implementers

            to member and non-member carriers upon request, for their own use or for their alliances and VSAs.

            A carrier can use each of its assigned USRs either in agreement with its partners for a service under a VSA or Alliance,
            or independently for one of its own non-VSA, non-Alliance services.

            Every Universal Service Reference is an 8-character string with the following format:
             * the prefix "SR"
             * 5 digits
             * 1 uppercase English letter (A-Z).
