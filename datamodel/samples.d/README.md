Sample data from external (non-DCSA) providers
==============================================

This directory contains sample data from code list provides such as
SMDG or UNECE. DCSA has collected them to show case how the data would
fit inside the datamodel or because DCSA relies on them in tests.


Disclaimer: DCSA does *not* guarantee that the lists are complete,
correct or up to date.  Implementors are expected to collect and
maintain the full lists themselves.
