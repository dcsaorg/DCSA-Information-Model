Unique identifier of the voyage within a service, assigned by carriers as specified by DCSA.

Carriers assign a Universal Voyage Reference (UVR) to a voyage,
either individually for non-VSA services or jointly for shared services under a VSA or Alliance.

Every Universal Voyage Reference is a 5-character string with the following format:
 * the last 2 digits of the year
 * 2 alphanumeric characters for the sequence number of the voyage
 * 1 character for the initial of the direction/haul (`N`orth, `E`ast, `W`est, `S`outh or `R`oundtrip).
