"""
Free-format identifier used to specify a certain type of arrival notice,
for example "English, consignee, USD" or "No charges, French".

Each publisher can choose their own criteria by which they categorize arrival notices,
as well as the format of this property. However, for each arrival notice publisher
the format must be consistent and predictable, in order to allow receivers
to programmatically determine whether each received arrival notice overrides
an earlier version of the arrival notice "of the same type" for the same transport document.

An arrival notice (including all its versions) is uniquely identified by the combination
of the `transportDocumentReference` and this `typeLabel`. Each version of an arrival notice
is uniquely identified by the combination of the `transportDocumentReference`, this `typeLabel`
and the `issueDateTime`.

Among the versions of arrival notices of the same type issued for the same transport document,
a version with a newer `issueDateTime` overrides a version with an older `issueDateTime`,
regardless of the `versionLabel` (which is a high-level label with business semantics
and may or may not change between timestamped versions).
