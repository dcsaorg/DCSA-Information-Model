# Simplified subset of the DCSA Booking API

This is the OpenAPI specification of **a simplified subset of** the DCSA Booking standard API.

**DO NOT USE** this specification for implementing the Booking API!

This specification is currently meant to be used **exclusively** as a side effect of building the new Java information model for the Booking standard and exporting the Booking Data Overview in the new format.
