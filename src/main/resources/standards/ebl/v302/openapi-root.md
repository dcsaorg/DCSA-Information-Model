# Simplified subset of the DCSA Bill of Lading API

This is the OpenAPI specification of **a simplified subset of** the DCSA Bill of Lading standard API.

**DO NOT USE** this specification for implementing the Bill of Lading API!

This specification is currently meant to be used **exclusively** as a side effect of building the new Java information model for the eBL standard and exporting the eBL Data Overview in the new format.
