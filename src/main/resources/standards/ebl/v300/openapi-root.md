# Simplified subset of the DCSA Bill of Lading API

This is the OpenAPI specification of **a simplified subset of** the DCSA Bill of Lading standard API.

**DO NOT USE** this specification for implementing the Bill of Lading API!

This specification is currently meant to be used **exclusively** for the purpose of mapping objects and attributes of the Arrival Notice API elements to the corresponding Bill of Lading ones during the design of the Arrival Notice standard.
